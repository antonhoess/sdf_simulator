* canvas_drawer.py: Don't use only a single vehicle, but use a list instead, allow to add more vehicles and iterate through all vehicles.
* gui.py: Check, if it would make sense to use a Grid for placing the GUI elements.
* gui.py: Add switch to allow plotting over time instead of 2D - but how to separate the components x and y? Make two graphs for each 2D graph?
* gui.py: Add slider for speed and for step width (t increment) and show the current values on a label.
* gui.py: Add to the reset button probably even more values os the time increment e.g.
* Check, if it makes sense to use canvas-functions as xview(), xview_scroll(), canvasx() and it's y-counterparts - probalby they are only interesting, if all items stay on the canvas and not when deleting all items in each cycle.
* Check, if it is feasible to keep track of all elements created (drawn) on the canvas and update them instead of deleting all and creating them anew.
* Unify all function and variable names and also structure them more, e.g. pack them in classes if useful.
* scalable_canvas.py: Try to unify the two functions that scale coordinates (for creating drawing elements and for the sclaed motion event) - attention: the order of multiplication and addition is changed and the mathematical inverse operator is used except for the invert_y.
* scalable_canvas.py: Instead of get_* and set_* use real getters and setters
* gui.py: Introduce if __name__ == "__main__": and restructure the code.
* gui.py: Put all Widget stuff in a separate class if possible.
* Put more comments in the code.
